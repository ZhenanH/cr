The Acacia Ridge Community Centre runs a large number of programs, including an employment assistance program, housing resource service, English language and literacy tutoring, and social enterprise activities. It also provides emergency relief, including food vouchers, and operates a Food Co-op. \n\nOur volunteers painted the hut a cheery yellow colour, with the assistance of trainees from a local Greening Australia project. The once drab and well-worn hut was transformed into a bright and clean space for the community to continue to enjoy for many years to come."

The Spring theme included a reading of “The Best Nest” by Dr. Seuss, followed by the kids decorating their own wooden birdhouses. \n\nThis year we also had a new addition dubbed “The Party Room”, which rewarded sixteen top-performing 5th grade students as nominated by their teachers. They decorated birdhouses, had healthy snacks, and were each given their own copy of James Patterson’s “Middle School” chapter book to take home. This is our 7th visit to the Arbor Hill school,"
